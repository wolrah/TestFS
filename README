TestFS

This project is nothing but a test filesystem implemented through FUSE using python-fuse.

It is a learning project to teach myself how to use FUSE.

While it may at times have practical functionality, nothing is ever guaranteed.

This project may be considered 100% public domain, no rights reserved.  If somehow something in it is worth copying, have at it.
